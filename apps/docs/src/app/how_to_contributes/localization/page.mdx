# üåç Localization Guide ‚Äî Translate FlowInquiry

FlowInquiry supports internationalization using [next-intl](https://next-intl.dev/), and you can help make it accessible in more languages.

No coding skills needed ‚Äî just basic JSON editing and language knowledge.

# üìÅ Folder Structure

All translation files live in:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="frontend" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="messages">
        <FileTree.File name="en.json" />
        <FileTree.File name="fr.json" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

Each file contains key-value pairs:

```
{
  "locale_switcher": {
    "fr": "French",
    "en": "English",
    "label": "EN"
  },
  "common": {
    "buttons": {
      "create": "Create",
      "creating": "Creating ...",
      "clear": "Clear",
      "submit": "Submit",
      "submitting": "Submitting ...",
      "cancel": "Cancel",
      "previous": "Previous",
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

You only need to update the values ‚Äî the keys must remain unchanged.

# üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute a Translation

1. Fork and Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry.git
cd flowinquiry
```

2. Add or Update a Language File
   To improve an existing language (e.g., fr.json):
   Open the file in `apps/frontend/messages/` and update any missing or incorrect translations.

To add a new language:
Copy the English file and rename it with your language code:

```bash
cp apps/web/messages/en.json apps/web/messages/es.json
```

Then update the values in es.json (Spanish in this example).

3. Submit a Pull Request
   Once you're done:

- Commit your .json file and any locale additions

- Push your branch

- Open a pull request on GitHub

Please include:

- Your locale code (e.g., es)

- What you translated or reviewed

- Any context you'd like to share

# üôè Tips

- Focus on quality, natural phrasing over literal translations.

- You can leave values in English if you're unsure ‚Äî others can improve them later.

- Don‚Äôt worry about perfection ‚Äî every contribution helps!
