# Introduction

## The Cost of Inefficient Team Collaboration

Imagine a growing company where different teams—from customer support to product development—each play a crucial role. As project requests and support needs multiply, teams struggle to keep track of who is responsible for what, leading to delays, missed deadlines, and strained communication. Customer support might need a technical fix for an issue, but without a clear line of communication or accountability, the request sits in limbo, impacting customer satisfaction and team morale.

In such scenarios, each team risks falling out of sync, with missed opportunities and inefficiencies becoming the norm. This type of collaboration breakdown is more than just frustrating—it’s costly. Studies show that companies with poor inter-team communication can see drops in productivity, lower employee morale, and ultimately, reduced revenue.
