# 🚀 Project Management

The **Project Management** module in FlowInquiry helps teams plan, organize, and track work across multiple projects.

Each **team** in FlowInquiry can manage **one or more projects**, enabling separation of concerns, feature-specific planning, and better visibility across initiatives. Projects serve as containers for related tickets and workflows, offering a structured way to deliver work.

This module connects tightly with tickets, workflows, epics, and iterations — supporting both agile and structured collaboration.
