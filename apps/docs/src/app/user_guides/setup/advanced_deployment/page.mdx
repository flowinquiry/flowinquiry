# Advanced Deployment

## Helm chart

### 🧰 Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- A running Kubernetes cluster (e.g. Minikube, K3s, GKE, EKS)

- `kubectl` and helm installed

- Your working directory contains:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="flowinquiry-k8s/scripts" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="backend-env.sh" />
    <FileTree.File name="frontend-env.sh" />
    <FileTree.File name="deploy-k8s-secret.sh" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

#### 🔧 Step 1: Generate Secrets and Create Kubernetes Secrets

Run the `deploy-k8s-secrets.sh` script:

```bash
./deploy-k8s-secret.sh

➜  scripts ✗ ./deploy-k8s-secret.sh
🛠️ Running backend-env.sh
🔐 Creating backend.env.local...
Enter your database password:
✅ Sensitive data has been written to ./backend.env.local with restricted permissions.
🌱 Environment check passed.
🛠️ Running frontend-env.sh
Creating ./frontend.env.local...
Enter the FlowInquiry back-end server URL address (e.g., http://localhost or http://localhost:8080): http://localhost:8080
✅ Appended AUTH_SECRET to ./frontend.env.local.
✅ Frontend environment initialization complete.
🔐 Creating Kubernetes Secret: flowinquiry-backend-secret
secret/flowinquiry-backend-secret configured
🔐 Creating Kubernetes Secret: flowinquiry-frontend-secret
secret/flowinquiry-frontend-secret configured
✅ All secrets created successfully.

```

This will:

- Prompt you to enter values (e.g., database password, backend URL)

- Generate backend.env.local and frontend.env.local

- Create two Kubernetes secrets:
  - flowinquiry-backend-secret

  - flowinquiry-frontend-secret

#### 🚀 Step 2: Install the Helm Chart

From the directory containing `flowinquiry-helm`, run:

```bash
helm upgrade --install flowinquiry ./flowinquiry-helm

➜  flowinquiry-k8s ✗ helm upgrade --install flowinquiry ./flowinquiry-helm
Release "flowinquiry" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!
NAME: flowinquiry
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon May 19 17:13:12 2025
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 2
TEST SUITE: None
```

#### 🧪 Step 3: Check Deployment

```
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
```

Ensure all pods (backend, frontend, postgresql, caddy) are running and services are created.

#### 🌐 Step 4: Access the Application

If you're using Minikube:

```bash
minikube service caddy --url
```

This will give you a URL like:

```
http://127.0.0.1:1234
```

Open it in your browser to access FlowInquiry.

#### 🧹 Step 5 (Optional): Uninstall

To remove the deployment:

```
helm uninstall flowinquiry
kubectl delete secret flowinquiry-backend-secret flowinquiry-frontend-secret
kubectl delete pvc --all
```

## Terraform
