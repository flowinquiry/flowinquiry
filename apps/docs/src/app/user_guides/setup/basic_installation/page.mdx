# Docker

## Multi-Platform Deployment

Our dedicated [location](https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/tree/main/apps/ops) provides all the resources needed for flexible deployment configurations. With both the frontend and backend packaged as
Docker images, FlowInquiry is ready to run on any platform compatible with containerized solutions, such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, AWS, Azure, and more

### Docker Compose

The Docker Compose example demonstrates how to quickly run FlowInquiry in a containerized environment, ideal for testing or local LAN use.
For more details, explore the flowinquiry-docker folder in the [flowinquiry-ops](https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/tree/main/apps/ops) repository.

### FlowInquiry Docker Deployment: HTTP and HTTPS

In a testing environment, you can deploy FlowInquiry and access it over your LAN network without setting up TLS/SSL.

In a production environment, especially if FlowInquiry is exposed to the public internet, it is strongly recommended to configure TLS/SSL to secure all communications.

FlowInquiry's Docker setup supports both HTTP and HTTPS configurations separately, allowing you to choose the appropriate setup based on your deployment environment.

The FlowInquiry Docker Compose setup uses [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) as a reverse proxy to serve HTTPS even for both localhost and LAN environments.
Caddy is configured with a Caddyfile that supports the domains `localhost` and `local.flowinquiry.io`

<Tabs items={["https", "http"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    Recommended for public deployments or production environments. Refer to the
    [Caddyfile for
    HTTPS](https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/blob/main/apps/ops/flowinquiry-docker/Caddyfile_https).

You can change the domain name to any name you prefer.

**Installing FlowInquiry**

Run one of the following scripts

```
# Using wget
wget -O install-flowinquiry.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/refs/heads/main/apps/ops/flowinquiry-docker/scripts/install-flowinquiry.sh && chmod +x install-flowinquiry.sh && ./install-flowinquiry.sh

# Or using curl
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/refs/heads/main/apps/ops/flowinquiry-docker/scripts/install-flowinquiry.sh -o install-flowinquiry.sh && chmod +x install-flowinquiry.sh && ./install-flowinquiry.sh
```

These scripts will guide you through the installation process with a few interactive prompts. You'll be asked to provide basic configuration details such as:

- Whether to enable SSL

- Your domain or IP address

```
Do you want to set up FlowInquiry with SSL? (y/n):
```

You can choose to enable or skip SSL configuration based on your deployment needs.

**Accessing FlowInquiry**

- Open your browser and go to `http://<LAN_IP>:1234`

- Find your LAN IP address in the log output. Look for a message like:

```bash
Using host IP address: 192.168.0.78
Your service will be available at: http://192.168.0.78:1234
Using host IP address: 192.168.0.78
```

In this example, you would access FlowInquiry at:
http://192.168.0.78:1234

- Login using the default administrator credentials:

- Username: admin@flowinquiry.io

- Password: admin

#### Local HTTPS

Caddy uses its local CA to issue certificates, which means that HTTP clients outside the container won‚Äôt automatically trust the TLS certificate served by Caddy.
To resolve this, you may need to install Caddy's root CA certificate in your host machine‚Äôs trust store.

The Caddy root CA certificate can be found at flowinquiry-docker/caddy/certificate-authority/root.crt. This file is only generated when you run the FlowInquiry stack
with Caddy included. For detailed steps, refer to the Caddy documentation: [Local HTTPS with Docker](https://caddyserver.com/docs/running#local-https-with-docker)

#### Upgrade FlowInquiry

TBD
