# Getting started

FlowInquiry back-end is a spring boot application, and it has several components:

- Spring Data
- Spring REST
- Spring Security
- Hibernate
- Liquibase

FlowInquiry uses Gradle as its build tool and includes the Gradle wrapper in the distribution, so there's no need to install Gradle separately.

## Get the latest sources from GitHub

The source code for FlowInquiry’s backend is available at: https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/tree/main/apps/backend

You can also clone the repository to your local machine using the command below and navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry.git
cd flowinquiry/apps/backend
```

## Development

### Folders organization

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="backend" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="server" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="commons" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="tools" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- `server` the FlowInquiry server sources
- `commons` the common codebase for FlowInquiry backend
- `tools` extra tools for FlowInquiry server such as liquibase database migration scripts and more

### Configure the application

To run the FlowInquiry backend, users need to provide their input in the local configuration file .env.local.

#### Checking environments

FlowInquiry's front-end requires Node and pnpm to be installed on your machine. You can run the command `pnpm check-env` in the flowinquiry root folder to verify if your machine is set up to work with FlowInquiry

        ```bash
        ➜  flowinquiry ✗ pnpm check-env

        > flowinquiry@0.0.1 check-env flowinquiry
        > tools/check-env.sh

        🔍 Starting environment check...

        ⚙️  Backend Requirements

        🔍 Checking Java version...
        ✅ Java version 21 detected.

        🔍 Checking Docker...
        ✅ Docker is installed and running.

        -----------------------------

        🎨 Frontend Requirements

        🔍 Checking Node.js version...
        ✅ Node.js version v20.18.1 detected.

        🔍 Checking pnpm version...
        ✅ pnpm version: 10.6.5

        =============================
        📋 Summary
        =============================
        ✅ Backend environment is properly configured.

        ✅ Frontend environment is properly configured.

        🌱 All environment checks passed!

        ```

#### Create a local configuration file `.env.local`

Run the command `pnpm backend:setup` in the flowinquiry's root folder to create a file `.env.local` in the folder `apps/backend`

        ```bash
        ➜  flowinquiry✗ pnpm backend:setup

        > flowinquiry@0.0.1 backend:setup flowinquiry
        > bash tools/setup/backend-env.sh

        🔐 Creating .env.local for backend...
        Enter your database password:
        ✅ Sensitive data has been written to /apps/backend/.env.local with restricted permissions.
        🌱 Environment check passed.
        ````

### Run application

#### Run postgres database

FlowInquiry uses PostgreSQL as its database and provides pre-configured PostgreSQL settings. You need to run the database before starting the FlowInquiry server.
Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine, then run the command `pnpm docker:up` from the flowinquiry's root folder to start the database

```bash
➜  flowinquiry ✗ pnpm docker:up

> flowinquiry@0.0.1 docker:up flowinquiry
> docker compose -f docker/services.yml up -d

[+] Running 1/1
 ✔ Container flowinquiry-postgresql-1  Started

```

<Callout type="error" emoji="️🚫">
  Make sure to create the `.env.local` file inside the `apps/backend` directory
  before starting the PostgreSQL database. This file contains the PostgreSQL
  password required by the PostgreSQL container to run properly.
</Callout>

#### Run flowinquiry server

<Tabs items={['Gradle', 'IntelliJ']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        From the root folder, run the command `pnpm backend:dev` in the flowinquiry's root folder

        ```bash
        ➜  flowinquiry✗ pnpm backend:dev

        > flowinquiry@0.0.1 backend:dev flowinquiry
        > ./gradlew :apps:backend:server:bootRun

        You can import the FlowInquiry server into IntelliJ as a Gradle project. Once imported, run the `io.flowinquiry.FlowInquiryApp` class as a standalone Java application

        ![IntelliJ](/images/flowinquiry_intellij.png)

        As similar than gradle command, it will take some time before the server APIs are accessible on the default port `8080`
