description: Get started with FlowInquiry's back-end development using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. Learn how to set up the project, configure the environment, and run the application.

import { Callout, FileTree, Tabs } from "nextra/components";

# Getting started

FlowInquiry back-end is a spring boot application, and it has several components:

- Spring Data
- Spring REST
- Spring Security
- Hibernate
- Liquibase

FlowInquiry uses Gradle as its build tool and includes the Gradle wrapper in the distribution, so there's no need to install Gradle separately.

## Get the latest sources from GitHub

The source code for FlowInquiry‚Äôs backend is available at: https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/tree/main/apps/backend

You can also clone the repository to your local machine using the command below and navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry.git
cd flowinquiry/apps/backend
```

## Development

### Folders organization

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="backend" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="server" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="commons" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="tools" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- `server` the FlowInquiry server sources
- `commons` the common codebase for FlowInquiry backend
- `tools` extra tools for FlowInquiry server such as liquibase database migration scripts and more

### Configure the application

To run the FlowInquiry backend, users need to provide their input in the local configuration file .env.local. FlowInquiry offers two options for creating this configuration file:

- Using Bash Scripts: Users can run provided Bash scripts, which prompt for inputs, validate the information, and then automatically generate the configuration file.
- Editing a Template Manually: A template configuration file (.env.local.example) is provided, allowing users to manually edit and create their .env.local file. This option is recommended for Windows users who cannot run Bash scripts.

        #### Checking environments

        FlowInquiry's front-end requires Node and pnpm to be installed on your machine. You can run the command `pnpm check-env` in the flowinquiry root folder to verify if your machine is set up to work with FlowInquiry

        ```bash
        ‚ûú  flowinquiry ‚úó pnpm check-env

        > flowinquiry@0.0.1 check-env flowinquiry
        > tools/check-env.sh

        ‚úÖ Frontend environment is properly configured.

        üå± All environment checks passed!

        ```

        then you run the command `pnpm setup:backend` in the flowinquiry's root folder to create a file `.env.local` in the folder `apps/backend`

        ```bash
        ‚ûú  flowinquiry‚úó pnpm setup:backend

        > flowinquiry@0.0.1 setup:backend flowinquiry
        > bash tools/setup/backend-env.sh

        Enter your database password:

        üå± Environment check passed.
        ````
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            Rename the file `.env.local.example` to `.env.local`, and edit the file content per instructions inline

            ```bash
            #!/bin/bash

### Run application

#### Run postgres database

FlowInquiry uses PostgreSQL as its database and provides pre-configured PostgreSQL settings. You need to run the database before starting the FlowInquiry server.
Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine, then run the command `pnpm docker:up` from the flowinquiry's root folder to start the database

```bash
‚ûú  flowinquiry ‚úó pnpm docker:up

> flowinquiry@0.0.1 docker:up flowinquiry
> docker compose -f docker/services.yml up -d

[+] Running 1/1
 ‚úî Container flowinquiry-postgresql-1  Started

```

<Callout type="error" emoji="Ô∏èüö´">
  Make sure to create the `.env.local` file inside the `apps/backend` directory
  before starting the PostgreSQL database. This file contains the PostgreSQL
  password required by the PostgreSQL container to run properly.
</Callout>

#### Run flowinquiry server

<Tabs items={['Gradle', 'IntelliJ']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        From the root folder, run the command `pnpm dev:backend` in the flowinquiry's root folder

        ```bash
        ‚ûú  flowinquiry‚úó pnpm dev:backend

        > flowinquiry@0.0.1 dev:backend flowinquiry
        > ./gradlew :apps:backend:server:bootRun
