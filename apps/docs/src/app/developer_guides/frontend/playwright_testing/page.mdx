# Playwright Testing Guide

This guide will help you understand how to write and run Playwright tests for the FlowInquiry frontend application.

## Introduction to Playwright

We picked Playwright for FlowInquiry’s frontend tests because it just makes life easier. It works with Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit, so we can quickly check that everything
behaves the same no matter what browser you’re using. Its API is super intuitive, letting us mimic clicks, type stuff into forms, and navigate around the app just like a real
person would. That means we catch weird bugs sooner, our CI runs faster, and we can focus on building cool features instead of chasing down flaky tests

## Project Setup

### Installation

Playwright is already configured in the FlowInquiry frontend project. The main configuration files and directories are:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="apps/frontend" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="playwright.config.ts" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="tests" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="home.spec.ts" />
      <FileTree.Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="home-page.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Configuration

The Playwright configuration is defined in `apps/frontend/playwright.config.ts`. This file specifies:

- Test directory location
- Browser configurations
- Retry settings
- Reporter settings
- Base URL for tests

Here's a snippet of the configuration:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: "./tests",
  fullyParallel: true,
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  reporter: "html",
  use: {
    baseURL: "http://localhost:3000",
    trace: "on-first-retry",
  },
  projects: [
    {
      name: "chromium",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Chrome"] },
    },
    {
      name: "firefox",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Firefox"] },
    },
    {
      name: "webkit",
      use: { ...devices["Desktop Safari"] },
    },
  ],
  webServer: {
    command: "pnpm run dev",
    url: "http://localhost:3000",
    reuseExistingServer: true,
    timeout: 120 * 1000, // 2 minutes
  },
});
```

## Writing Tests

### Page Object Model Pattern

FlowInquiry uses the Page Object Model (POM) pattern for organizing test code. This pattern creates an abstraction layer between test code and page-specific details, making tests more maintainable.

<Callout type="info">
  The Page Object Model pattern separates the test logic from the page
  implementation details, making tests more maintainable and easier to update
  when the UI changes.
</Callout>

#### Directory Structure

Tests are organized as follows:

- `tests/` - Contains all test files (\*.spec.ts)
- `tests/pages/` - Contains page object models

### Creating a Page Object

Page objects should be created in the `tests/pages/` directory. Here's an example of a page object for the home page:

```typescript
// tests/pages/home-page.ts
import { expect, Locator, Page } from "@playwright/test";

/**
 * Page Object Model for the Home page
 * This class encapsulates the selectors and actions for the home page
 */
export class HomePage {
  readonly page: Page;
  readonly emailInput: Locator;
  readonly passwordInput: Locator;
  readonly signInButton: Locator;
  readonly errorMessage: Locator;

  constructor(page: Page) {
    this.page = page;
    this.emailInput = page.getByLabel("Email");
    this.passwordInput = page.getByLabel("Password");
    this.signInButton = page.getByRole("button", { name: /sign in/i });
    this.errorMessage = page.locator(".text-red-700");
  }

  /**
   * Navigate to the home page
   */
  async goto() {
    await this.page.goto("/");
  }

  /**
   * Verify that the home page has loaded correctly
   */
  async expectPageLoaded() {
    try {
      // In production, we should be redirected to dashboard
      await expect(this.page).toHaveURL("/portal/dashboard");
    } catch (error) {
      // In test environment without proper auth setup, we might stay at login
      console.log(
        "[DEBUG_LOG] Not redirected to dashboard, checking if still on login page",
      );
      await expect(this.page).toHaveURL("/login");
    }
  }

  /**
   * Login with the provided credentials
   */
  async login(email: string, password: string) {
    await this.emailInput.fill(email);
    await this.passwordInput.fill(password);
    await this.signInButton.click();
  }

  // Additional methods...
}
```

### Writing Test Cases

Test cases should be created in the `tests/` directory with the `.spec.ts` extension. Here's an example of a test file:

```typescript
// tests/home.spec.ts
import { test } from "@playwright/test";
import { HomePage } from "./pages/home-page";

test.describe("Home Page", () => {
  test("should navigate to home page and login successfully", async ({
    page,
  }) => {
    const homePage = new HomePage(page);

    // Navigate to the home page
    await homePage.goto();

    // Verify redirection to login page
    await homePage.expectRedirectToLogin();

    // Login with admin credentials
    await homePage.login("admin@flowinquiry.io", "admin");

    // Verify redirection to dashboard after login
    await homePage.expectPageLoaded();
  });

  test("should stay on login page when using incorrect credentials", async ({
    page,
  }) => {
    const homePage = new HomePage(page);

    // Navigate to the home page
    await homePage.goto();

    // Login with incorrect credentials
    await homePage.login("wrong@example.com", "wrongpassword");

    // Verify error message is displayed
    await homePage.expectLoginError();
  });
});
```

## Best Practices

### Locator Strategies

Playwright provides several ways to locate elements. Here are the recommended strategies in order of preference:

<Steps>
  ### Use Accessibility Locators
  These are the most reliable and resilient to UI changes:
  ```typescript
  page.getByRole("button", { name: "Sign In" })
  page.getByLabel("Email")
  page.getByText("Welcome")
  page.getByTestId("login-form")
  ```

### Use CSS Selectors as a Fallback

When accessibility locators aren't available:

```typescript
page.locator(".login-form");
page.locator("#email-input");
```

### Avoid XPath

XPath selectors are brittle and harder to maintain.

</Steps>

### Test Isolation

Each test should be independent and not rely on the state from previous tests. Use the `beforeEach` hook to set up the test environment:

```typescript
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  // Set up test environment
  await page.goto("/");
});
```

### Assertions

Use Playwright's built-in assertions for reliable testing:

```typescript
// Check URL
await expect(page).toHaveURL("/login");

// Check element visibility
await expect(page.getByRole("button", { name: "Sign In" })).toBeVisible();

// Check element text
await expect(page.getByText("Welcome")).toBeVisible();

// Check element count
await expect(page.getByRole("link")).toHaveCount(5);
```

## Running Tests

### Running Tests Locally

To run all frontend tests from the root folder:

```bash
pnpm test:frontend
```

To run tests with UI mode (for debugging) from the root folder:

```bash
pnpm test:ui:frontend
```

If you need to run a specific test file, you can navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd apps/frontend
pnpm playwright test tests/home.spec.ts
```

## Debugging Tests

### Using UI Mode

Playwright's UI mode is the easiest way to debug tests:

```bash
pnpm test:ui
```

This opens a UI where you can:

- Run specific tests
- See test steps and screenshots
- Inspect the DOM at each step
- View network requests

### Using Debug Logs

You can add debug logs to your tests:

```typescript
console.log("[DEBUG_LOG] Your debug message");
```

In CI, logs prefixed with `[DEBUG_LOG]` will be displayed in the test output.

### Trace Viewer

Playwright can capture traces for failed tests:

```typescript
// In playwright.config.ts
use: {
  trace: "on-first-retry",
}
```

You can view traces in UI mode or by opening the trace file in Playwright Trace Viewer.

## Examples

### Testing Authentication

```typescript
test("should authenticate user", async ({ page }) => {
  const loginPage = new LoginPage(page);
  await loginPage.goto();
  await loginPage.login("admin@flowinquiry.io", "admin");
  await expect(page).toHaveURL("/portal/dashboard");
});
```

### Testing Form Submission

```typescript
test("should submit form", async ({ page }) => {
  const formPage = new FormPage(page);
  await formPage.goto();
  await formPage.fillForm({
    name: "Test User",
    email: "test@example.com",
    message: "This is a test message",
  });
  await formPage.submitForm();
  await formPage.expectSuccessMessage();
});
```

### Testing Navigation

```typescript
test("should navigate between pages", async ({ page }) => {
  const homePage = new HomePage(page);
  await homePage.goto();
  await homePage.navigateTo("About");
  await expect(page).toHaveURL("/about");
});
```
