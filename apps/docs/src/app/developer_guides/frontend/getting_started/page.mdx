# Getting Started

FlowInquiry front-end uses [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/) framework to develop its UI.

## Get the latest sources from GitHub

The source code for FlowInquiry’s front-end is available at:
https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/tree/main/apps/frontend

You can also clone the repository to your local machine using the command below and navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry.git
cd flowinquiry/apps/front-end
```

## Development

### Folders organization

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="frontend" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="public" />
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

- `public` contains static assets, such as files and images, served by Next.js
- `src` the FlowInquiry's frontend source code

### Configure the application

To run the FlowInquiry frontend, users need to provide their input in the local configuration file `.env.local`. To do that you need to execute scripts in the bash environments to create
the `.env.local` file.

#### Checking environments

FlowInquiry's front-end requires Node and pnpm to be installed on your machine. You can run the command `pnpm check-env` in the flowinquiry root folder to verify if your machine is set up to work with FlowInquiry

    ```bash
        ➜  flowinquiry ✗ pnpm check-env

        > flowinquiry@0.0.1 check-env flowinquiry
        > tools/check-env.sh

#### Create the local configuration file `.env.local`

Run the command `pnpm frontend:setup` in the flowinquiry's root folder

```bash
➜  flowinquiry✗ pnpm frontend:setup

> flowinquiry@0.0.1 frontend:setup flowinquiry
> bash tools/setup/frontend-env.sh

```

#### Run in dev mode

You can launch the nextjs development server by running `pnpm frontend:dev` in the flowinquiry's root folder

it will start the FlowInquiry frontend development server at the default port `3000`

```bash
➜  flowinquiry ✗ pnpm frontend:dev
> flowinquiry@0.0.1 frontend:dev flowinquiry
> turbo run dev --filter=flowinquiry-frontend
