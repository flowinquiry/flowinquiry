import { Callout, FileTree } from "nextra/components";

# Getting started

Flowinquiry uses [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) as the static site generator to generate the content on
[FlowInquiry docs](https://docs.flowinquiry.io).

## Get the latest sources from GitHub

The source code for FlowInquiry’s docs is available at: https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/tree/main/apps/docs

You can also clone the repository to your local machine using the command below and navigate to the docs directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry.git
cd flowinquiry/apps/docs
```

## Add or edit content

FlowInquiry has the below folder structure

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="docs" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src/app" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="about" defaultOpen />
      <FileTree.Folder name="developer_guides" defaultOpen />
      <FileTree.Folder name="how_to_contributes" defaultOpen />
      <FileTree.Folder name="user_guides" defaultOpen />
      <FileTree.File name="_meta.global.js" defaultOpen />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

File `_meta.global.js` is used as a centralized place to define global navigation and sidebar settings
across the FlowInquiry's documentation

```
export default {
  index: {
    title: "Introduction",
    type: "page",
    display: "hidden",
  },
  developer_guides: {
    type: "page",
    title: "Developer Guides",
    items: {
      index: "Programming languages and development tools",
      frontend: "Front-end",
      backend: {
        title: "Back-end",
        items: {
          getting_started: "Getting-started",
          high_level_architect: "High-level architect",
          database_migration: "Database migration",
          integration_testing: "Integration Testing", //added the integrating section
        },
      },
      deployment: {
        title: "Deployment",
        items: {
          build_docker_image: "Build FlowInquiry Docker Images (Optional)",
          docker: "Docker",
          kubernetes: "Kubernetes",
        },
      },
      documentation: "Documentation"
    },
  },
  // ...
  about: {
    type: "page",
    title: "About",
  },
};
```

Please make sure when you add the new content to the FlowInquiry's documentation, you put the proper entry into
documentation's section such as `developer_guides`, `user_guides`, etc.
