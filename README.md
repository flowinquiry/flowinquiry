## Getting Started

FlowInquiry uses a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/) structure to manage all parts of the application — including the backend, frontend, and documentation — in a single repository. This approach ensures consistency, shared tooling, and easier cross-service collaboration.

All core services are located in the apps/ directory:

* apps:
  * backend: The Spring Boot service that powers the API layer, business logic, database integrations, workflows, and backend features of FlowInquiry.
  * frontend: The Next.js web application that provides the user interface for the platform. It integrates with the backend via REST APIs, handles authentication, and supports both freemium and premium features through dynamic configuration.
  * ops: the central repository that provides artifacts and configuration files to help customers deploy FlowInquiry using Docker, Kubernetes, and other environments.
  * docs: A documentation site built with a [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) static site generator, providing guides, and setup instructions for developers and users.

To get started with setting up the frontend and backend locally, follow the official developer guides:

* [Frontend Setup Guide](https://docs.flowinquiry.io/developer_guides/frontend/getting_started)

* [Backend Setup Guide](https://docs.flowinquiry.io/developer_guides/backend/getting_started)

* [Documentation Setup Guide](https://docs.flowinquiry.io/developer_guides/documentation)

These guides provide step-by-step instructions to help you configure your environment, install dependencies, and run the services in development mode.

## 🚀 Quick Launch

Have Docker installed? Get FlowInquiry running in seconds!

```
# Using wget
wget -O install-flowinquiry.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/refs/heads/main/apps/ops/flowinquiry-docker/scripts/install-flowinquiry.sh && chmod +x install-flowinquiry.sh && ./install-flowinquiry.sh

# Or using curl
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowinquiry/flowinquiry/refs/heads/main/apps/ops/flowinquiry-docker/scripts/install-flowinquiry.sh -o install-flowinquiry.sh && chmod +x install-flowinquiry.sh && ./install-flowinquiry.sh
```
This will:

* Download the necessary setup scripts directly from FlowInquiry's GitHub repository

* Prompt you for basic inputs (such as whether to enable SSL)

* Automatically configure and launch FlowInquiry
