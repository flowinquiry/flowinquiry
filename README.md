## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Java 21 or higher
* Gradle 8 or higher
* PostgreSQL (or compatible database)

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the repository:
```
   git clone git@github.com:flowinquiry/flowinquiry-server.git
   cd flowinquiry-server
```
#### 2. Configure application parameters

   Set up the application secrets by running the following script:
```bash
scripts/create_secrets.sh
```
This script generates the secrets for the PostgreSQL database and the JWT_BASE64_SECRET, storing them in the local .env.local file.

**Important**: For security reasons, ensure that .env.local is excluded from version control (e.g., by adding it to .gitignore).

#### 3. Build and run application

##### Run the postgres database

FlowInquiry utilizes PostgreSQL as its database and comes with pre-configured PostgreSQL settings. We recommend using Docker as a virtualized container for PostgreSQL. Docker makes it easy to test and run the same PostgreSQL version the FlowInquiry team uses daily, reducing the risk of database compatibility issues.

Ensure Docker is installed on your machine, then start the database by running the following command:
```bash
docker compose -f docker/services.yml up
```

##### Run the server

From the root folder, run the command:
```bash
./gradlew :server:bootRun
```
It may take some time before the server APIs are accessible on the default port 8080
```bash
âžœ  flowinquiry-server git:(main) ./gradlew :server:bootRun
INFO in org.springframework.boot.logging.logback.SpringBootJoranConfigurator@5618d5e5 - Registering current configuration as safe fallback point
