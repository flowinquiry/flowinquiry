### Problems FlowInquiry Solves with Specific Use Cases

FlowInquiry addresses several challenges faced by organizations in managing cases, tickets, and team communication. Here are some specific use cases:

* **Project management** Teams can use FlowInquiry as a project management tool to create, assign, and prioritize tasks, track progress with workflows, and ensure timely completion with SLAs and automation. Its collaboration features, real-time updates, and integration capabilities streamline workflows and boost productivity.

* **Team Communication and Collaboration** Effective communication within and across teams can be difficult in large organizations, especially when requests involve multiple departments or external stakeholders. FlowInquiry acts as a centralized platform where requests are logged, tracked, and routed through clearly defined workflows. This reduces miscommunication, prevents delays, and ensures all parties are aligned on priorities.

* **Service Request Tracking for IT Teams** IT teams managing internal service requests often encounter bottlenecks due to unclear processes or manual tracking. FlowInquiry allows IT departments to automate workflows for common requests such as software installation, access management, or issue resolution. The system ensures each request is assigned, processed, and resolved within agreed SLAs.

* **On-Call System Management** In an on-call system, teams often face challenges in managing incoming requests or incidents, particularly when multiple shifts or team members are involved. FlowInquiry ensures that each request follows a well-defined workflow, with SLAs for escalation and resolution. This helps reduce response times, avoids missed escalations, and provides clear accountability for handling incidents.

* **Case Management in CRM Applications**  CRM applications often struggle to manage customer cases effectively, especially when handling inquiries, complaints, or service requests. FlowInquiry enables teams to define custom workflows tailored to specific case types, such as refunds, escalations, or product inquiries. SLAs for each workflow stage ensure customers receive timely updates and resolutions, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

By tailoring workflows to these and other scenarios, FlowInquiry empowers teams to streamline operations, meet deadlines, and deliver exceptional service to both internal and external stakeholders.

## Getting Started

FlowInquiry uses a [monorepo](https://monorepo.tools/) structure to manage all parts of the application ‚Äî including the backend, frontend, and documentation ‚Äî in a single repository. This approach ensures consistency, shared tooling, and easier cross-service collaboration.

All core services are located in the apps/ directory:

* apps:
  * backend: The Spring Boot service that powers the API layer, business logic, database integrations, workflows, and backend features of FlowInquiry.
  * frontend: The Next.js web application that provides the user interface for the platform. It integrates with the backend via REST APIs, handles authentication, and supports both freemium and premium features through dynamic configuration.
  * docs: A documentation site built with a [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) static site generator, providing guides, and setup instructions for developers and users.

To get started with setting up the frontend and backend locally, follow the official developer guides:

* [Frontend Setup Guide](https://docs.flowinquiry.io/developer_guides/frontend/getting_started)

* [Backend Setup Guide](https://docs.flowinquiry.io/developer_guides/backend/getting_started)

These guides provide step-by-step instructions to help you configure your environment, install dependencies, and run the services in development mode.

## Deploy FlowInquiry
To ensure a smooth deployment process, we provide detailed guidelines for deploying FlowInquiry in various environments. These instructions cover setup steps, configuration details, and best practices for deploying the service effectively. You can find the deployment documentation [here](https://docs.flowinquiry.io/developer_guides/deployment)
